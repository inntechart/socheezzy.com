        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>This website uses – like most other sites – cookies. Cookies are small text files that will be stored on your
            computer, phone, tablet or comparable unit with the purpose of recognizing the device, remembering preferences,
            create statistics and target adverts. Cookies can contain text, numbers or dates but no personal data is stored
            in a cookie, and they cannot contain malicious code (e.g. a virus). We, and the following data processors have
            access to the data stored: Microsoft Ltd., Google Ltd., Match2One AB and Facebook Ltd.</p>
        <p>When you use our website you accept the use of cookies, including third party cookies, but it is at any given
            time possible to delete or block for cookies. In the bottom of this page you can see which cookies are stored on
            your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device when you use our website.</p>
        <p>If you delete or block cookies adverts will become less relevant for you and appear more often. You may also
            experience that the website does not function perfectly and there may be content you do not have access to. </p>
        <p>Cookies are also stored in log files that are collected from the site’s users. Log files are generated from all
            websites and this site is no exception. Basically log files contain an overview over 1) which pages that has
            been visited on the site, 2) when they have been visited, and 3) where they have been accessed from, which means
            the log files collect the user’s IP address. Based on the collected log file data we are only able to see what
            city you access the site from and not your exact geographic location. You can read more about how we process
            your personal data, including your IP address in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Said log files will be used both for monitoring traffic on the site and as a security measure. One of the
            reasons why we collect IP-adresses is that we can use them to prevent hacker attacks.</p>
        <p>If we in the log files can see an unusual pattern in where the traffic is coming from it can be a sign of an
            attempted hacker attack. By monitoring the users’ location via IP-addresses we are better equipped to prevent
            hacker attacks.</p>
        <p>Log files, including IP-addresses are stored for 5 years before they are deleted.</p>


        <h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>
